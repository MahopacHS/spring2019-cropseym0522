Is this an error?\n\nThe program still runs because a negative number is still a number so python sees it how it is and puts it in the code. Also no this is not an error. \n\n2. Would it be difficult to write a program which did the opposite (conversion F to C)? Explain. \n\nNo it would not be difficult to write a program which did the opposite of converting celcius to fahrenheit because you would just be writing the opposite of what you said. So instead of writing (c * 1.8) + 32 you would write (f/1.8) - 32 to convert it to celcius.\n\n3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why?\n\nI did store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line. This would make your program easier to understand because you can see what the value is of that letter to make it easier to see what will happen in the code instead of having all of these numbers in the way that are close together and making it hard to read.\n"
