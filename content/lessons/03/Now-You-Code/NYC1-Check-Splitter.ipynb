What happens when you enter `TWO` instead of `2` for the number of people dining? or $60 as the amount of the check, instead of 60? \nif you type in two or $60 there becomes a error but when you type in 2 and 60 there is no error.\n\n2. What type of error is this? Do you think it can be handled in code?\nthis is called a value error and this can be fixed by going back into your code on the line it says has an error. so yes i think it  can be handeled in code. \n\n3. Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining? Does the program run? Does it make sense? \nthere is an error because you can not have half of a person.\n"
