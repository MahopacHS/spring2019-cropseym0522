      "source": "# Now You Code 2: Indigo Montoya\n\n[The Pricess Bride](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/princess_bride/) is an adventure film from the 80's, a true cult classic. One of the many notable scenes involves a character Indigo Montoya who explains his character's motivation for revenge through the catch-phase:\n\n\"Hello. My name is Indigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!\"\n\nYou can watch the clip here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY4cnMmo9qw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY4cnMmo9qw)\n\nWrite a program in Python which asks the user to enter **your name**, a **relative** and an **past-tense action**. For example if you enter \"Indigo Montoya\", \"Father\" and \"killed\", the program will then output:\n\n\"Hello. My name is Indigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!\"\n\nOr you could input \"Mike Fudge\", \"Uncle\" and \"Tickled\" to get:\n\n\"Hello. My name is Mike Fudge. You Tickled my Uncle. Prepare to die!\"\n"

Why? it still runs because a code can't tell the difference between a name and a action\n\n2. What type of error it when the program runs but does not handle bad input? \n\nit is called a logical error \n\n3. Is there anything you can do in code to correct this type of error? Why or why not? \n\nyes you would have to go back into your code and figure out what needs to be fixed."
