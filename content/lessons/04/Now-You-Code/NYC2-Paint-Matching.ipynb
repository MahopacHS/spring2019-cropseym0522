Modify the program to print `that is not a paint quality` and then exit in those cases. the code still runs and it doesn't know that what you answered is not a choice\n\n\n2. What happens when you enter something other than `'y'` or `'n'` for color matching? Re-write the program to print `you must enter y or n` whenever you enter something other than those two values. \nthe code still runs when you enter something other than 'y' or 'n'. \n\n3. Why can't we use Python's `try...except` in this example?\nthis is because there is no error in the code\n\n4. How many times (at minimum) must we execute this program and check the results before we can be reasonably assured it is correct? \nyou would have to exectue this program four times"
