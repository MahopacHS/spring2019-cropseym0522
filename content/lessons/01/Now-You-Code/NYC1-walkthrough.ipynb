What happens when you enter `TWO` instead of `2` for the number of people dining? or $60 as the amount of the check, instead of 60? if you type in two or $60 there becomes a error but when you type in 2 and 60 there is no error.\n2. Why do you think this happens? two should be written as a number and 60 should not have a dollar sign so that python understands the code you put in.\n3. Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining? there is an error because you can not have half of a person.\n"
